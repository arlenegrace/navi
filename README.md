Static product-page website for applications, products and services.


## Features
- **Easy to use**: Everything is given a descriptive name, CSS is split into separate files for maintainability and reusability, and comments added for additional clarity and readability.
- **Lightweight**: The entire visible webpage is written in less than 280 lines of HTML and only 6 small JavaScript functions, improving the user experience on slower devices. 
- **Responsive**: Automatically changes layout based on resolution and screen size, and the themes gallery transitions into full sized previews for phones and tablets.
- **Mixed theme**: Navi was designed with a mix of light and dark themes based on each section's purpose.
- **Animations**: Elements appear on page-load with different animations to enhance its visual appeal, and to direct the user's attention based on order of appearance.
